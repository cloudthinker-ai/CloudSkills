# GCP Idle Resources Skill

Detect unused and idle GCP resources with anti-hallucination guardrails and cost waste estimation.

**Relationship to other GCP skills:**

- `gcp-idle-resources/` -> "What is wasting money" (idle detection rules, cost estimation, protection label checks)
- `gcp/` -> "How to execute" (parallel patterns, filtering, monitoring aligners, billing/pricing scripts)
- `gcp-rightsizing/` -> "What is oversized" (utilization thresholds, downsize recommendations)

## CRITICAL: Idle Resource Detection Rules (Anti-Hallucination)

**These rules are MANDATORY when detecting idle resources. Violating them produces recommendations that can cause data loss or outages.**

### Rule 1: Unattached Persistent Disk != Always Deletable

Detached PDs (no `users` field) may be intentional (warm standby, manual backups, data archives). Report but NEVER auto-recommend deletion without user context.

```
WRONG:  "disk-abc is detached, delete it"
CORRECT: "disk-abc is detached, candidate for review. Created 2025-06-15, 100GiB pd-ssd, est. $17/mo"
```

### Rule 2: Stopped VMs (TERMINATED) Still Incur PD + IP Costs

When a Compute Engine instance is stopped (status=TERMINATED), compute charges stop but attached Persistent Disks and reserved External IPs continue to incur charges.

**MANDATORY**: Report the ongoing cost of stopped instances, not just the compute savings.

```
WRONG:  "vm-abc is stopped, no cost"
CORRECT: "vm-abc is stopped since 2025-12-01. Ongoing cost: 2x PDs ($24/mo) + 1 external IP ($7.20/mo) = $31.20/mo"
```

### Rule 3: External IP Cost: $0.010/hr ($7.20/mo) When Unused

Since February 2024, GCP charges for ALL external IPv4 addresses. Unused reserved IPs (status=RESERVED, not attached to any resource) cost $0.010/hr ($7.20/mo). In-use IPs on standard VMs cost $0.004/hr ($2.88/mo). IPs on forwarding rules are free.

```
WRONG:  "External IP attached to running instance is free"
CORRECT: "All external IPs cost money. IP 35.x.x.x is RESERVED (unattached) -- $7.20/mo pure waste"
```

### Rule 4: Cloud NAT: $0.0014/hr Per VM (Capped at $0.044/hr) + $0.045/GB

Cloud NAT charges per VM instance using the gateway ($0.0014/hr per VM, capped at $0.044/hr for 32+ VMs), plus $0.045/GB data processed. Even idle Cloud NAT gateways with a few VMs incur cost.

```
WRONG:  "Cloud NAT has low traffic, minimal cost"
CORRECT: "Cloud NAT nat-abc serves 5 VMs but < 10 active connections/day avg. Fixed cost: ~$5.04/mo + data processing"
```

### Rule 5: Snapshot Cost: $0.050/GiB/mo (Standard Regional)

Old snapshots accumulate silently. 1TiB of old snapshots = $51.20/mo. Snapshots backing machine images are required.

**MANDATORY**: Cross-reference with `gcloud compute images list` and `gcloud compute machine-images list` to exclude snapshots backing active images before flagging.

```
WRONG:  "snap-abc is 90 days old, delete it"
CORRECT: "snap-abc is 90 days old, 200GiB, est. $10/mo. NOT backing any image. Candidate for review."
CORRECT: "snap-def is 120 days old, 500GiB. BACKS image image-xyz -- skipped (required by image)."
```

### Rule 6: Never Recommend Deletion -- Only Flag

Always phrase results as "candidate for review" not "should be deleted". Resources may be intentionally idle (DR, staging, warm standby).

```
WRONG:  "Delete these 5 disks to save $87/mo"
CORRECT: "5 detached disks identified as candidates for review. Estimated waste: $87/mo if all are unnecessary."
```

### Rule 7: Check Protection Labels Before Flagging

Look for labels like `do-not-delete`, `keep`, `protected`, `backup`. GCP labels are always lowercase with hyphens/underscores. If found, mark as "PROTECTED -- skipped" in the output.

```
WRONG:  "disk-abc (labeled keep) is idle, candidate for deletion"
CORRECT: "disk-abc: PROTECTED (label: keep) -- skipped"
```

### Rule 8: Cloud SQL activationPolicy=NEVER Means Stopped, Not Idle

Cloud SQL instances with `activationPolicy=NEVER` are explicitly stopped by the user. They still incur storage costs. Do NOT confuse stopped Cloud SQL with idle (running but unused) Cloud SQL.

```
WRONG:  "Cloud SQL my-db is idle (activationPolicy=NEVER)"
CORRECT: "Cloud SQL my-db is STOPPED (activationPolicy=NEVER). Storage cost continues: 100GiB SSD = $17/mo"
```

### Rule 9: GKE Node Pools -- Only Flag Zero Nodes + No Autoscaler

A node pool with 0 nodes but autoscaler enabled is intentional (scale-to-zero). Only flag pools with 0 nodes AND autoscaling disabled or absent.

```
WRONG:  "node-pool-abc has 0 nodes, candidate for review"
CORRECT: "node-pool-abc has 0 nodes, autoscaler ENABLED (min=0, max=5) -- intentional, skipped"
CORRECT: "node-pool-def has 0 nodes, autoscaler DISABLED, initial=3. Candidate for review: may be abandoned."
```

### Mandatory Pre-Detection Checklist

**Before writing ANY idle resource analysis, verify ALL of the following:**

- [ ] Project context established (gcloud config or `--project`)
- [ ] Protection labels checked before flagging any resource (see Rule 7)
- [ ] Cost estimates use current on-demand pricing (see pricing table below)
- [ ] Results clearly state "candidates for review" not "should be deleted" (see Rule 6)
- [ ] Each resource shows estimated monthly waste
- [ ] All costs include currency unit (USD, tax-exclusive)
- [ ] Snapshot-image cross-reference performed (see Rule 5)
- [ ] Parallel execution used for all gcloud API calls (see `gcp/SKILL.md`)

## Idle Resources Script (`get_idle_resources_gcp.sh`)

**DO NOT read or modify the script file.** Only source and call the functions.

**SETUP** (at the start of your script):

```bash
source ./_skills/connections/gcp/gcp-idle-resources/scripts/get_idle_resources_gcp.sh
```

**All functions enforce anti-hallucination rules**: protection label checks, cost estimation, "candidate for review" language, TOON output format.

**FUNCTION REFERENCE**:

| Function | Purpose | Signature |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `gcp_idle_disks` | Unattached Persistent Disks with cost estimate | `[--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_ips` | External IPs with status RESERVED (unattached) | `[--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_vms_stopped` | VMs stopped > N days with attached PD + IP cost | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_nat` | Cloud NAT gateways with minimal/no traffic | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_lb` | Forwarding rules with 0 healthy backends | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_snapshots` | Snapshots older than N days, not backing images | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_cloudsql` | Cloud SQL instances with very low utilization | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_gke_nodepools` | GKE node pools with 0 nodes + autoscaler disabled | `[--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_vpc_connectors` | VPC connectors with zero throughput | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_filestore` | Filestore instances with 0 connected clients | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |
| `gcp_idle_summary` | Run all checks, unified waste summary with total | `[--days N] [--project PROJECT]` |

**RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW** (every idle resource analysis):

1. **Run `gcp_idle_summary`** for a unified view of all idle resource types with total waste estimate
2. For deeper analysis of a specific category, run the individual function
3. Always review "PROTECTED" items separately -- they were intentionally labeled

**Examples:**

```bash
source ./_skills/connections/gcp/gcp-idle-resources/scripts/get_idle_resources_gcp.sh

# Full idle resource scan (default project)
gcp_idle_summary

# Full scan in specific project
gcp_idle_summary --days 30 --project my-project-id

# Detached Persistent Disks only
gcp_idle_disks

# Idle Cloud SQL instances (14-day window)
gcp_idle_cloudsql --days 14

# Unused External IPs
gcp_idle_ips

# Long-stopped VMs (60-day threshold)
gcp_idle_vms_stopped --days 60

# Idle Cloud NAT
gcp_idle_nat --days 14

# Old snapshots (120-day threshold)
gcp_idle_snapshots --days 120

# Abandoned GKE node pools
gcp_idle_gke_nodepools

# Unused VPC connectors
gcp_idle_vpc_connectors --days 7

# Orphaned Filestore instances
gcp_idle_filestore --days 14
```

## GCP Detection Commands Reference

Quick reference for the gcloud CLI commands used to detect each idle resource type.

| Resource | Command | Key Filter |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Unattached PD | `gcloud compute disks list --filter="-users:*"` | No `users` field = unattached |
| Unused External IP | `gcloud compute addresses list --filter="status:RESERVED AND addressType:EXTERNAL"` | RESERVED = unattached |
| Stopped VM | `gcloud compute instances list --filter="status:TERMINATED"` | TERMINATED = stopped |
| Cloud NAT | `gcloud compute routers nats list --router=R --region=REG` | Check via Cloud Monitoring metrics |
| Forwarding rules | `gcloud compute forwarding-rules list` | Check backend health via backend-services |
| Snapshots | `gcloud compute snapshots list` | Age filter + image cross-reference |
| Cloud SQL | `gcloud sql instances list` | CPU utilization via Cloud Monitoring |
| GKE node pools | `gcloud container node-pools list --cluster=C --location=L` | Check `autoscaling.enabled` + node count |
| VPC connectors | `gcloud compute networks vpc-access connectors list --region=R` | Check throughput via Cloud Monitoring |
| Filestore | `gcloud filestore instances list` | Check connected clients via Cloud Monitoring |

## Cloud Monitoring Metrics Used

| Resource | Metric | Namespace | Aligner |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Cloud NAT | `nat/open_connections` | `router.googleapis.com` | ALIGN_MEAN |
| Cloud SQL CPU | `database/cpu/utilization` | `cloudsql.googleapis.com` | ALIGN_MEAN |
| Cloud SQL connections | `database/network/connections` | `cloudsql.googleapis.com` | ALIGN_MEAN |
| VPC connector | `connector/sent_bytes_count` | `vpcaccess.googleapis.com` | ALIGN_RATE |
| Filestore | `nfs/server/connected_client_count` | `file.googleapis.com` | ALIGN_MEAN |
| LB requests | `https/request_count` | `loadbalancing.googleapis.com` | ALIGN_RATE |

**CRITICAL**: `alignment-period` MUST be >= 60 seconds when using aligners other than ALIGN_NONE.

---

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` on monitoring | Missing `monitoring.timeSeries.list` permission | Check service account roles |
| `NOT_FOUND` for Cloud SQL metrics | Instance is stopped (`activationPolicy=NEVER`) | Report as stopped, not error (Rule 8) |
| Disk cost seems wrong | pd-extreme IOPS cost not included | Add provisioned IOPS cost for pd-extreme |
| Snapshot count very high | Account has many automated backups | Use `--days` to filter by age, cross-ref images |
| Cloud NAT shows as idle but is needed | Used for private subnet egress | Check VPC route tables before flagging |
| GKE node pool false positive | Pool uses autoscaler with min=0 | Check `autoscaling.enabled` before flagging (Rule 9) |
| VPC connector shows 0 throughput | Connector created but service uses Direct VPC Egress | Check Cloud Run/Functions config |
